**Mecha: Immense Warfare** began development in late 2016, early 2017. After participating in a business course to build a legit studio out of KR Game Studios, I determined that the costs of producing a fully fledged Trading Card Game was simply not viable at that time, so I shelved it.

Recently however, I've picked this project back up again, and I've paired it down to the basics necessary to produce a high-quality prototype. The card count is much lower (less than 30), the art costs are much lower (thanks to my fantastic business partner and artist Evan Hartshorn), and my goal is much simpler - I need a prototype to pitch to publishers.

The prototype consists of the deck lists found in the concepts section, each fully illustrated and ready to be played, and a fully illustrated playmat. The prototype itself might be salable, but I haven't settled on that just yet; I may make it available to patrons via patreon.
