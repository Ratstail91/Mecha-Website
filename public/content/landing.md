Mecha: Immense Warfare pits you against an opponent in a battle of Mechas - wild combat machines controlled by hastily built radio towers. Get to the other side of the battlefield and attack your opponent five times to win! But look out for your opponent's Mechas, as they can attack, damage and destroy your Mechas, and your towers!
